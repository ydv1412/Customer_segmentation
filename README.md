# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to group similar customers together to help businesses **personalize marketing strategies** and **enhance customer experiences**.

## 🏆 Key Objectives
- **Analyze customer spending behavior** using clustering techniques.
- **Identify distinct customer segments** based on purchasing habits.
- **Visualize clusters** to gain business insights.
- **Optimize marketing strategies** using data-driven customer segmentation.

## 📂 Dataset Summary
- **Source**: Customer transaction dataset
- **Key Features**:
  - **Monetary Value**: Total spending by a customer.
  - **Frequency**: Number of transactions made.
  - **Recency**: Time since the last transaction.
  - **Demographics**: Age, gender, income (if available).

## 🔍 Machine Learning Techniques Used
| Model                      | Purpose |
|----------------------------|---------|
| **K-Means Clustering**      | Groups customers into similar segments |
| **Hierarchical Clustering** | Alternative clustering method for comparison |
| **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** | Reduces dimensionality for better visualization |

✅ **Best Performing Model:** **K-Means Clustering (Elbow Method for optimal K selection)**.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified **high-value customers** who contribute significantly to revenue.
- Segmented customers into **low, medium, and high spenders**.
