<h1><u> Online_retail Customer Segmentation</u></h1>
<u><h3>The need of Customer Segmentation:</u></h3>
Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers into segments up based on common characteristics such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively.
#Customer segmentation is one of the most important marketing tools at our disposal, because it can help a business to better understand its target audience.


</h1></u>RFM Analysis:</h1></u>
RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value.
R(Recency): Number of days since last purchase
F(Frequency): Number of transactions
M(Monetary): Total amount spent 

<h1><u>Approach:</h1></u>
This was an unsupervised machine learning(clustering) project. In this project I have been provided with online retain dataset. This dataset consists of 541909 rows and 8 features. My task in this project was to perform EDA and group this dataset into optimum clusters based on features, using different clustering techniques.

I have divided this project into five major parts which are Exploratory Data Analysis, RFM analysis, handling null values, outliersâ€™ removal and dataset clustering.


<h1><u>Conclusion:</h1></u>
<li>I used three clustering techniques which are Centroid Based(K-Means), Hierarchical and DBSCAN. Out of all three techniques K-Means is based performing algorithm.</li>
<li>At the end of this project I came to the conclusion that this online retail dataset can be nicely clustered into three clusters.</li>
